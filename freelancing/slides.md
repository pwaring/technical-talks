 - I write PHP and maintain legacy code and systems
 - I like trains, politics and technology (@pwaring)

# Topics

 - Mix of my experiences and practical advice
 - Why you might want to try freelancing (and why not)
 - How to make freelancing work
 - Whatever you want - ask me anything!

# Why?

 - Greater control over your destiny
 - Variety of work and clients
 - Flexibility - hours and workload

# Why not?

 - Fewer employment rights
 - Limited cover for sickness, emergencies, redundancy
 - No paid leave
 - Buying/renting property is hard

# Types of freelancing mode

 - Fixed-term contract
 - Project work
 - Regular clients

# Fixed term contract

 - Most popular method - 'contracting'
 - Single client, exclusive
 - Usually on-site
 - Usually full-time
 - Initial term of 3-6 months
 - Extensions often available

# Project work

 - Multiple projects, multiple clients
 - Usually one project per client
 - Works well for standard tasks, e.g. WordPress theme design
 - Can be hard to keep a pipeline of work
 - Often fixed pricing

# Regular clients

 - Work for the same clients on projects
 - Non-exclusive
 - Retainers are great if available
 - Not many freelancers offer this
 - My niche area

# Finding work

 - Networking
 - Simple website
 - Social media profile

# Networking

 - Continuous process over many years
 - Start now
 - Depth rather than breadth
 - Repeat attendance not wide attendance
 - Don't go just for networking

# Simple website

 - Keep it really simple
 - If in doubt, use WordPress with custom theme
 - List contact details, portfolio and CV
 - Blog if you have time
 - Keyword-rich domain

# Social media profile

 - Two networks are worthwhile
 - Twitter
 - LinkedIn

# Time management

 - Sales meetings are expensive - ration them
 - Lawyer model: 1 hour meeting, then charge

# Money management

 - Cash flow is everything
 - Strict credit terms - 14 days or less
 - Every payment, move 30% into liability account
 - Use this account solely for settling tax bill

# Value Added Tax

 - Effectively adds 20% to your prices
 - Not everyone can reclaim it
 - Paperwork and penalties if you get it wrong
 - Avoid if possible

# Terms of business agreements

 - Reply to every initial enquiry with these
 - Make everyone sign before starting work
 - Keep them short and simple
 - Email me if you want mine

# Mistakes to avoid

 - Fixed price jobs
 - Underselling yourself
 - Taking every job offered
 - Going to every meeting
 - Not standing your ground

# Thanks for listening
