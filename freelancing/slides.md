# whoami

 - Freelancing full-time since July 2015 (part-time since 2000)
 - PHP developer and Linux system administrator
 - Background in academia and insurance
 - Specialise in legacy code/systems and financial services
 - I like trains, politics and technology (@pwaring@fosstodon.org)
 - You may know me from: Geek Walks, Currybeer (but not golf or moths)

# Topics

 - Mix of my experiences and practical advice
 - Why you might want to try freelancing (and why not)
 - How to make freelancing work
 - Whatever you want - ask me anything!

# Why?

 - Greater control over your destiny
 - Variety of work and clients
 - Flexibility - hours and workload

# Why not?

 - Limited cover for sickness, emergencies, redundancy
 - No paid leave
 - Buying/renting property is harder
 - You are responsible for *everything*

# Types of freelancing mode

 - Fixed-term contract
 - Project work
 - Regular clients

# Fixed term contract

 - Single client, exclusive
 - Usually on-site
 - Usually full-time
 - Priced on a day rate
 - Initial term of 3-6 months
 - Extensions often available
 - Over 2 years: possibly an employee

# Project work

 - Multiple projects, multiple clients
 - Usually one project per client
 - Works well for standard tasks, e.g. WordPress theme design
 - Can be hard to keep a pipeline of work
 - Often fixed pricing
 - Competing globally

# Regular clients

 - Multiple projects per client
 - Non-exclusive
 - Retainers are great if available
 - Not many freelancers offer this
 - My niche area

# Finding work

 - Networking
 - Simple website

# Networking

 - Continuous process over many years
 - Start now
 - Depth rather than breadth
 - Repeat attendance not wide attendance
 - LinkedIn can be worthwhile

# Simple website

 - Keep it really simple
 - If in doubt, use WordPress with non-default theme
 - List contact details, portfolio and CV
 - Blog if you have time
 - Keyword-rich domain

# Time management

 - Sales meetings are expensive - ration them
 - Pre-2020: First hour meeting + travel is free, then charge
 - Now: 30 minutes free consultation, remote-only

# Money management

 - Cash flow is everything
 - Strict payment terms - 14 days or less
 - Every payment, move 30% into liability account
 - Use this account solely for settling tax bill

# Value Added Tax

 - Effectively adds 20% to your prices
 - Not everyone can reclaim it
 - Paperwork and penalties if you get it wrong
 - Unpaid tax collector for HMRC
 - Avoid if possible

# Terms of business agreements

 - Reply to every initial enquiry with these
 - Make everyone sign before starting work
 - Keep them short and simple
 - Email me if you want mine

# Work/life balance

 - Separate email accounts for personal/business
 - Separate phone numbers (and maybe physical phone)
 - Don't check work email or phone outside working hours
 - Install Workrave
 - Take regular time off
 - Don't work evenings/weekends

# Mistakes to avoid

 - Underselling yourself
 - Taking every job offered
 - Going to every meeting

 
# Make your life easier

 - Take regular breaks and holidays
 - Keep personal and work life separate (email, phone, finances)
 - Don't check work stuff outside of work hours
 - Trust your instincts
 - Stand your ground


# Thanks for listening
