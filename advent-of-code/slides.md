 - How to make freelancing work
 - Questions at any time

# What is Advent of Code?

 - Annual coding challenge: 1 puzzle (in two parts) per day in Advent
 - Puzzles get progressively harder as time goes on
 - Your input is unique (test input is shared)
 - Brute-force solutions often don't work
 - Don't have to solve puzzle n to unlock n+1
 - Puzzles are always available, can try previous years
 - Supported by sponsorship and donations

# Languages

 - Choose a language you want to learn / improve
 - Often a different paradim, e.g. functional vs imperative
 - C and Go are my choices most years

# Tips

 - Read the puzzle descriptions carefully
 - Edge cases often catch people out
 - Think about possible interpretations

# Tips

 - Don't get disheartened
 - Sometimes puzzles are wrong or ambiguous
 - Ambiguous: easy vs impossible
 - Focus on algorithms and data structures
 
# Testing

 - Testing really helps, even for seemingly simple puzzles
 - Break every step into a separate function for testing
 - Get test input working first - but beware of edge cases

# C

 - Unity is a very simple framework
 - Write tests as C functions with 1+ assertions
 - Include as a submodule
 - A good Makefile is your friend - makes it almost rapid prototyping
 
# Go

 - One directory per puzzle part, otherwise Go throws a strop
 - github.com/MakeNowJust/heredoc: Embedding strings for tests
 - github.com/stretchr/testify: Better assertions / testing
 - github.com/samber/lo: Maps, filters, reduce etc.
