# Assembly

 - Have a soft spot for this
 - Forces you to think about implications
 - No one writes it anymore (even many CS students)

# C/C++

 - No garbage collection
 - Overflow all the things!
 - Smash the stack for fun and profit
 - Necessary evil for kernel level

# Go

 - C with garbage collection and syntax sugar
 - Google wrote it so must be cool

# Java

 - C++ for dummies
 - Omnomnom your memory is delicious
 - Write once, run nowhere

# C\#

 - Microsoft's "Not Invented Here" solution to Java
 - For people who haven't heard of Linux
 - Disadvantages of Java, plus less cross platform support

# Python

 - WTF whitespace?
 - 2 to 3 breaks everything, including `print`

# Perl (5)

 - No boolean data type
 - `1;`

# Ruby

 - Don't get me started on Gems
 - Run everything as root, call it DevOps

# Bash

 - Great for 5 line scripts
 - More than 20 LoC, unreadable mess
 - Has arrays, scoping, functions that no one uses

# Lisp

 - `()((((())(())(()))(())))))))))((((((())`

# JavaScript

 - Current choice for hipsters
 - Good buzzword if you want recruiter spam
 - Bonus points for node, ember, angular etc.

# PHP is awesome

 - Support for every database
 - One framework per developer
 - Sysadmin, Web dev, GUI apps
 - Cross platform

# PHP is awesome

 - Exceptions, OO but not forced
 - Namespaces, closures
 - Dependency management
 - Easy deployment (c.f. Rails, NodeJS)

# Conclusions

 - PHP is great, all other languages suck
 - Write everything in PHP
 - Shameless plug: hire me ;-)
