In the Second World War, the German forces used a machine codenamed Enigma to encrypt their communications. At the time, this encryption was sufficiently powerful to resist most form of cryptanalysis, including frequency analysis and brute forcing. However, weaknesses in the design and operation ultimately led to the cracking of Engima.

In this talk we will examine some of the flaws which ultimately allowed the UK and its allies to break Engima and read important military messages sent by the Germans. Although over 50 years old, the story still contains lessons which are relevant to modern cryptography, and demonstrates the enormous cost which faith in flawed security can cause.
