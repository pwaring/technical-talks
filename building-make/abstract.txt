This month Paul Waring will be talking about Make, the automated system used to build software, libraries and documentation. Paul will provide an overview of how Make works, including its mechanisms for only re-building what has changed since it was last run, some common mistakes to avoid, and an example of how he builds newsletters, books and training course material with a single Makefile.
