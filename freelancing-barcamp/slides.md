 - You may know me from: Geek Walks, Currybeer

# Topics

 - Why you might want to try freelancing (and why not)
 - How to make freelancing work
 - Ask me anything (at the end/break/lunch)

# Why?

 - Greater control over your destiny
 - Variety of work and clients
 - Flexibility - hours and workload

# Why not?

 - Limited cover for sickness, emergencies, redundancy
 - No paid leave
 - You are responsible for *everything*
 - Buying/renting property is hard(er)

# Fixed term contract

 - Single client, exclusive
 - Usually on-site
 - Usually full-time
 - Initial term of 3-6 months
 - Extensions often available

# Project work

 - Multiple projects, multiple clients
 - Usually one project per client
 - Works well for standard tasks, e.g. WordPress theme design
 - Can be hard to keep a pipeline of work
 - Often fixed pricing

# Regular clients

 - Multiple projects per client
 - Non-exclusive
 - Not many freelancers offer this
 - My niche area

# Networking

 - Continuous process over many years
 - Start now
 - Depth rather than breadth
 - Repeat attendance not wide attendance

# Simple website

 - Keep it really simple
 - If in doubt, use WordPress with non-default theme
 - List contact details, portfolio and CV
 - Blog if you have time

# Money management

 - Cash flow is everything
 - Strict credit terms - 14 days or less
 - Every payment, move 30% into liability account
 - Use this account solely for settling tax bill

# Make your life easier

 - Take regular breaks and holidays
 - Keep personal and work life separate (email, phone, finances)
 - Don't check work stuff outside of work hours
 - Trust your instincts
 - Stand your ground

# Thanks for listening
